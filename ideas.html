        It's a supernatural mystery, maybe a werewolf or a vampire. Maybe cheesy, I don't know. Howling 4 and
        Silverbullet and Late Phases come to mind. I'm going with the werewolf idea for now.

        Murder mystery. People are being killed, is this the work of a serial killer or something else? The bodies are
        mauled as if by an animal. The police don't know what they are looking for.
        You are an investigator of some sort. Maybe private eye, police detective, amateur sleuth, person who finds
        themself mixed up in all this. Maybe player can choose character which has advantages and drawbacks.
